# Recipe Rating Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project aimed at predicting recipe ratings. The goal is to analyze recipe data and build predictive models that can forecast a recipeâ€™s rating based on its features.

## Project Overview

In this project, various machine learning techniques are applied to:
- **Analyze recipe data:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights.
- **Build baseline models:** Develop initial predictive models to serve as benchmarks.
- **Optimize models:** Utilize grid search and hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy.

The project leverages Python and Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, modeling, and evaluation.

## Repository Structure

- **EDA - Jack.ipynb:** Exploratory Data Analysis notebook with a focus on understanding the recipe dataset.
- **EDA.ipynb:** Additional notebook for detailed exploration and visualization of the data.
- **baseline_model.ipynb:** Notebook implementing the baseline predictive model for recipe ratings.
- **grid_search.ipynb:** Notebook dedicated to hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.
- **.ipynb_checkpoints/:** Directory containing Jupyter Notebook checkpoints.
